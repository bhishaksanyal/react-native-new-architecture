# React Native New Architecture Working Group

This is a discussion-only repository to coordinate and support the rollout of the **React Native New Architecture**. 
You can access to the working group via the [Discussions Tab on Github](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/discussions).

The intention of this group is to offer a space where the community can meet and discuss about the New Architecture of React Native (being the Fabric Rendered and the TurboModule system). Moreover, we're going to use this working group to share information and updates with the wider community for the sake of transparency.
